This is a game about escaping a spooky mansion.
You need to click through the storyline at the beginning, unless you take the easy way out.
Complete the quest in each room, and then exit through the front gate.
For the Courtyard, enter a name; for the Foyer, click the button; for the Patio, click the stones in the correct order; for the Bedroom, sleep; for the Parlor, follow the conversation; for the Dining Room, enter the key from the Parlor conversation; there are no challenges for the Attic, Basement, or Kitchen.
After doing so, go back to the Courtyard and click the exit button.
Then click the leave button to officially end the game. (Taking the easy way out will automatically put you at this point)


# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
